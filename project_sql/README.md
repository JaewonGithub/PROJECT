### The Questions answered through SQL queries:
1. What are the top-paying Data Scientist jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in-demand for Data Scientists?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries among Data Scientist jobs?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# Utilized Tools
To thoroughly explore the Data Scientist jobs in the job market, I utilized several essential tools :
- **SQL:** Serving as the foundation of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and discover crucial insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** Selected as the optimal database management system for efficiently managing the data for the analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My preferred tool for database management tasks and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Critical for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analyses, facilitating project tracking.

# Analysis
### Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the Data Scientist job market. <br>Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:
<br>

### 1. Top Paid Data Scientist Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles amongst all Data Scientist jobs, I filtered data Scientist positions by the location and average yearly salary. For the location, I conditioned it  as 'Anywhere,' which allows the output of all remote and onsite jobs.
This query highlights the highly paid opportunities in the Data Scientist job market.
```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    name AS company_name,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_posted_date

FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

WHERE 
    job_title LIKE '%Data_Scientist%' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 

ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 10
```
